  {"title": "Joe Biden's talk of 'healing' is pointless, and will be seen as weakness by the right",
    "content": "Normal. The United States is returning to normal. During Joe Biden’s inauguration, the commentary was overwhelmingly about a country slowly regaining consciousness, blinking away the bad dream that was Donald Trump. That state of normal was one of not just reinstating all the protocols and rituals of high office, but of the pastoral hand of the president. Biden will now “heal” the nation and rebuild America’s standing in the world. “Civility” will cleanse the US of the previous administration’s toxicity.\n\nBut against the backdrop of the past four years in general and the previous two weeks in particular, the ceremonials all felt a bit flat, like trying to burn incense to banish the smell of a rotting corpse. Trump may be gone as president, but the morbidities he exposed remain. They hang heavily in the air: the 74 million people who voted for him despite four years of lies and carnage; the proportion of voters who still think the election was stolen; the ongoing round-up of those who stormed the Capitol; the hundreds of thousands of lives claimed by coronavirus.\n\nNone of this was wrought by Trump’s hand alone. None of this could have happened without a pre-existing political culture, the “normal” to which the country now yearns to return. But every significant historical moment needs a narrative, and this was it: Trump had wounded a previously healthy America, divided it and lowered its tone, and Biden would now lay his healing hands on it with the help of a diverse coalition of grownups.\n\nIn her book Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents, Isabel Wilkerson likens the US to an old house, flawed in foundation, wrecked by age, weakened by cosmetic changes that never address the structural flaws. “You may not want to go into the basement after a storm to see what the rains have wrought,” she writes. “Choose not to look, however, at your own peril. Whatever is lurking will fester whether you choose to look or not. Ignorance is no protection from the consequences of inaction. Whatever you are wishing away will gnaw at you until you gather the courage to face what you would rather not see.”\n\nThe speed with which Trump’s presidency sent the US into a vortex of racial and social discord is the first clue that the old house was built on shaky foundations. These forces cannot be summoned overnight. They were gnawing away at the core of the country long before Trump became president. They are, in fact, why Trump became president. In describing the effects of Covid-19 on those with even mild pre-existing conditions, a doctor told me that the virus is a “mortality accelerant”. It takes the thing that might have claimed you in 20 or 30 years, and weakens your body so that it claims you today.\n\nSo let us look at the “normal” that Trump disrupted. Before he took office, the US was a country in which, since 9/11, far-right extremists have been responsible for almost three times as many attacks as Islamic terrorists. The year 2019 ended up being the deadliest on record for domestic terrorism in the US since then. Before Trump, while the country’s first African American president was in power, the Black Lives Matter movement was founded in protest at the impunity of those who kill black Americans. And despite the widely accepted fiction that Trump’s popularity was a white working-class revolt, he won against Hillary Clinton among high-income white voters, who went on to benefit from a tax-cut windfall.\n\nIn a country already riven by economic and class inequality, Trump proved how easily such divisions could be exploited to benefit rightwingers promising economic prosperity for some at the cost of the rest. It may seem that, after four long years of disruption, what is needed is a quiet spell of stability. But what this moment signifies is not a retreat by the forces that Trump has brought to the surface, but a temporary scattering before they regroup (in “some form”, as Trump himself said).\n\nThe last four years of Trump were hell. What a relief it's finally over\nFrancine Prose\nRead more\nTo talk about normality, civility, reaching across the divide and healing at a time like this, when millions have rejected that offering at the polls and hundreds marched on the Capitol, is pointless. For the duly elected Democratic party to feel it needs to reassure voters that it comes in peace is an act of weakness – as if it has no radical plans to take on foundational issues and reorder economic and racial relations in the country. This conciliation is a win for the American right – not only for its Capitol-insurrectionist wing, but for its longer-term scaremongering about the “radical left”. This is already evident in the backlash against Biden’s first executive orders that, in merely undoing what Trump established, are seen as “culture war aggression”.\n\nBiden should be leading a government ready to take on the twin challenges of rooting out white supremacy and rebalancing the economy, yet it risks being one that aims only to fix the leaks of the past four years. This should be a government that stops papering over the cracks, and finally confronts the causes of divisions and embeds permanent reform. Otherwise, though Trump may be gone, the nightmare will be ongoing.\n\nNesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist\n"},

  {"title" : "How Race Affects U.S. Politics, from Elections to the Capitol Attack",
    "content" :  "Zerlina Maxwell, A03, wants to change politics as we know it. Because what we’ve come to think of as politics in America today, she argues, doesn’t reflect who we really are. \nAccording to the Pew Research Center, white voters will be a minority of the American electorate by 2045. In her new book, The End of White Politics, Maxwell writes that as American demographics shift, our political candidates need to meet the moment.\n“America is evolving. Does the future of the Democratic Party look like a 70-year-old white man?” she asks. “With the makeup of the electorate shifting so dramatically, why hasn’t that also changed the makeup of those we choose to put into positions of power?” \nMaxwell, a veteran Democratic strategist, MSNBC analyst, and talk show host on Peacock TV and Sirius XM radio, makes the case that a more inclusive approach to politics—one that acknowledges white privilege, celebrates diversity, and doesn’t write off interest groups after their ballots have been cast—can also be more successful. The book, which offers a sharp critique of politicians on both sides of the aisle, was named one of Time Magazine’s 100 must-read books of 2020. \nMaxwell grew up in a Black family in the predominantly white suburb of Millburn, New Jersey. When she arrived at Tufts, she felt the challenge of being a person of color on campus. “Navigating spaces that are majority white as a woman of color is unique. You’re both hypervisible and completely invisible,” she writes. “All eyes stare in your direction when the topic of race predictably comes up during collegiate discussions.”\n\nBut her time at Tufts also widened her perspective. An international relations major, she studied abroad in Spain and met classmates from all over the world. She captained the track and field team, competing in the high jump, long jump, and pentathlon, and discovered an interest in media and politics that led to her current career. “Race and Gender in the Media was probably one of my favorite classes,” she says. “I remember we watched an episode of Sex and the City and discussed the portrayal of white privilege and racial bias, which was so on the money when I think about it now.”\nAfter college, Maxwell earned a law degree and worked on both the Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton campaigns, helping to craft their messaging and policy platforms. Now, between her Twitter account and talk shows, she’s shaping the narrative of the current political landscape, with an emphasis on putting the issues facing marginalized groups front and center. \nPoliticians can no longer focus on winning the hearts and minds of white voters, while merely dabbling in the “identity politics” of so-called special interest groups, she argues. To win in the future, she says, Democrats must anticipate and craft policy around the diverse needs of women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ communities. \n“We’ve always been doing identity politics in America; it’s just that up to this point in time, white has been the only identity that has mattered,” she writes. \nMaxwell spoke with Tufts Now about writing the book and watching how many of the arguments she makes in it have already been borne out in the months since its publication.\nThe title and message of your book are bold. Where did the idea for the The End of White Politics arise?\nIt’s a statement of aspiration for sure. But it also realizes that we’re doing white politics now, we’re centering white people and white issues and white voices in the media as well as in our conversation about politics. And we don’t even notice. And any time we diversify things we call it “identity politics,” as if white isn’t an identity. It is, and Trump exploited that in 2016.\nBut the emerging majority coalition is not white. In 2045, for the first time, white voters will be the minority of the American electorate, and that’s going to have a lot of consequences. \nThe book isn’t about white voters not being considered. It’s about expanding the spectrum of issues we can talk about and care about and work toward improving based on everyone’s experiences.\nYou handed in your draft of this book at the beginning of March 2020. Look at all that’s happened since then: the pandemic, the killing of George Floyd, Biden and Harris’s election win and Trump’s refusal to concede, and then the insurrection at the Capitol building that left five dead. You set out to deconstruct U.S. political thinking so that it no longer centers on white politics. This concept seems even more relevant given the events of the past year.\nIn the last chapter of the book, I write how I’m sitting there on Super Tuesday, wondering how we ended up with two old dudes [at the end of the primaries]. How did we get here? But the historic Senate wins in runoff elections in Georgia [by two Democrats, one Black and the other Jewish] and the violent insurrection at the Capitol I think prove my thesis that America will see a lot of consequences from demographic shifts. One of them, what I'm focusing on in the book, is electoral consequences. The coalition of people of color—Black voters, Latinx voters, AAPI [Asian American and Pacific Islander] voters, and indigenous voters—they are going to create a majority coalition that will potentially allow Democrats to win.\nThe pandemic has been clarifying, and we're still having a lot of things clarified for us. But one of the things that was clarifed is all of the systemic injustice that activists and leaders have been pointing out for generations.\nOne of the lines I circled three times in the book is “When you’re accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression.” How do you see that playing out?\nThis year has been one in which injustices have been so obvious. They were revealed by the pandemic, they were revealed by the former president, they were revealed in the January 6 insurrection. It’s been painful, but on the positive side it's wonderful that there are more white Americans who are seeing the world the way that Black Americans have been living it.\nIt's important for every white person out there to understand that when you live in a body that is white, you are treated better, you are treated differently. Whether you're rich and famous or you're a working-class white person, it doesn't matter. What it means is that you could storm the Capitol with weapons and camouflage on, break windows, and you can run all the way into the House floor or the Senate floor and you will probably not be shot. You will not be hurt, you will not be [immediately] arrested. You will walk out and get on your airplane to go home. I mean, most of them went all the way back home to their beds, they slept in their beds, after they put a gallows outside Congress.\nAnd if you are still today wondering if white privilege is a thing? You are willfully blind. You are lying to yourself, you're lying to us when you say you don't believe it.\nYou worked on the Hillary Clinton campaign, and you’ve said you regret that Black feminist leadership within that campaign wasn't enough to help her win. What advice do you have for the next female candidate or the candidate of color who wants to run a presidential campaign? What needs to happen to ensure those mistakes don't get made again?\nWell, if it’s Stacey Abrams she won’t make mistakes (laughs). But I think there's something that happened between Hillary Clinton and this moment, which is that Joe Biden asked Kamala Harris to be the vice president and they won. We have shattered a glass ceiling, and that’s really important and never should be overlooked.\nOne of the things that was amazing to watch was the Hillary alumni who joined up on 2020 campaigns and affected the messaging of the 2020 candidates. Elizabeth Warren had a Hillary alum in her campaign who wrote her speeches with a racial justice lens. Kirsten Gillibrand’s press secretary was a Hillary alum who helped her focus on intersectionality. The thing about working on a campaign is that you internalize the shortcomings of one election, and then act on them in future campaigns.\nOne of the things I loved about the book was your ability to capture the drama of being in the room when big decisions on campaigns were being made. What advice do you offer students who might be thinking about politics as a career?\nI want younger people to read this book and think of politics as a profession. And not just a profession for a politician. Politics is a profession for strategists, operatives, organizers, activists, legislative aides. If you are a recent college graduate wondering what am I going to do with my life because of the pandemic or the recession: There is a campaign you can work on somewhere.\nPeople think that all they can do to shape the world around them is to go protest. And while that is important, that is not the only thing you can do. You can go work in a campaign and make the candidate see something different. Or make the candidate say the things that are related to the policy that you were protesting last week. \nSpeaking of messaging, Biden ran on a campaign of healing the country. Can that message work, given how bitterly divided the nation is?\nHealing comes through accountability; it doesn’t come from papering over problems and trying to move on. I think that with Joe Biden, healing is something he will be able to do in terms of the trauma and the grief that Americans are experiencing on a daily basis, because of COVID and the economy and so many things. But I think we need to be as progressive as possible and as bold as possible. There is absolutely no excuse to hold back now. What are you waiting for?\nJanelle Nanos is a business reporter at the Boston Globe."}
