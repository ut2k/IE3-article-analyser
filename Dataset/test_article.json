  {"title":  "The Economic Benefits of Legalizing Weed",
      "content":  "Although the Presidential election drew most of the attention in November of 2020, there were several other important decisions made at the polls as well: notably, several states held votes to determine the future of the legal cannabis industry in one form or another. Taking a leaf out of Colorado or Washington’s book, four states—New Jersey, South Dakota, Montana, and Arizona—decided to make marijuana consumption for recreational purposes legal.1\uFEFF Mississippi also voted to allow medical marijuana.\n\nAll told, more and more states are moving to legalize marijuana (whether for medicinal or recreational use, or both), and the impact has already been tremendous. The legal changes have spawned a burgeoning industry of legal cannabis companies, including those which aim to research and develop cannabis-based medical products, those which are working to distribute and grow marijuana, and many others. All told, more than half of U.S. states have medical marijuana laws on the books, and fifteen states have legalized certain quantities of marijuana for recreational use as well.2\uFEFF 3\uFEFF\n\nThe economic benefits of legalizing weed have already been apparent as the first states have moved to change their legal positions. Overall, legal marijuana could mean a big push for state economies and big bucks for both the state and the federal governments.4\uFEFF Below, we'll explore some of the key economic benefits of legal marijuana.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nThere has been a growing popular movement in the United States to legalize marijuana for medicinal and recreational uses, with several states adopting such measures already.\nOne motivation for legalization is the economic benefits that can come from the regulated commercial availability of marijuana.\nIncreased tax revenues, job growth, and investment opportunities all are powerful incentives to push for legalization.\nImpact on Tax Revenue\nBetter than expected sales of marijuana in Colorado and Washington over the past several years have resulted in buoyant tax revenues. In 2019, Colorado collected more than $302 million in taxes and fees on medical and recreational marijuana. Sales in the state totaled over $1.7 billion.5\uFEFF 6\uFEFF Sales in the U.S were $12.2 billion in 2019 and projected to increase to $31.1 billion by 2024, according to a report from Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics.7\uFEFF Local research supports this view as well; a report from the Colorado State University-Pueblo's Institute of Cannabis Research recently found that the legal cannabis industry has contributed more than $80.8 million to the local economy in 2017, primarily through taxes and other fees.8\uFEFF Should marijuana become legal on a federal level, the benefits to the economy could be exceptional: A report from cannabis analytics company New Frontier suggests that federally legal pot could generate an additional $105.6 billion in aggregate federal tax revenue by 2025.9\uFEFF\n\nThat is the carrot dangled before many states. In December 2019, it was reported that since January 2018, California’s cannabis sales had generated 411.3 million in excise tax, $98.9 million in cultivation tax, and $335.1 million in sales tax.10\uFEFF The Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission reported in November 2019 that in the first year of opening marijuana retailers, $393.7 million was generated in gross sales.11\uFEFF\n\nIncome and Jobs\nSetting up marijuana nurseries and dispensaries would be the first step for the states that voted in favor of medical marijuana. These would not only create jobs but also set the ball rolling for economic activity in the pot industry in these areas. In the case of states like California and Nevada where such infrastructure already exists, the economic impact has become more quantifiable as the sector has matured.\n\nAn RCG Economics and Marijuana Policy Group study on Nevada says that legalizing recreational marijuana in the state could support over 41,000 jobs till 2024 and generate over $1.7 billion in labor income.12\uFEFF The ICF study estimates at least 81,000 additional direct, indirect, and induced jobs in California as a result of legalized marijuana sales. It also projects an increase in total labor income by at least $3.5 billion.13\uFEFF\n\nNew Frontier's report predicting the impact of federally legal marijuana suggests that nationwide legalization could generate 1 million jobs by 2025.9\uFEFF These jobs would likely come from the quickly growing industry which would spring up across the nation. Workers would be needed to farm, process, distribute, and sell marijuana-based products. Further, there would be ample opportunities for secondary industries that are related to legal cannabis although not directly involved in its production and distribution. These might include software developers, financing services, construction companies, and many others.\n\nInvestment Opportunities\nLegal marijuana presents the possibility of tremendous benefits to economies on a local and a national scale. It also could help to secure the investment portfolios of investors across the country and further afield as well. While marijuana remains illegal on the federal level, it is difficult for investors to capitalize on the growth of the industry. The number of marijuana-related companies trading on public stock exchanges is minuscule, and while investors do have the option of working with over-the-counter exchanges, many of the most successful businesses in the early legal cannabis space have been based in Canada or other countries.\n\nShould marijuana become legal on the national level, marijuana companies would be free to list their stocks on all U.S. exchanges, thereby enhancing liquidity and opening up access to many more investors. Should the growth rates for the cannabis space continue as they have in recent years, it's likely that investors would express a keen interest in the industry.\n\nSaved Money\nWhen considering the economic benefits of legal marijuana, it's important to think of the money that might be saved as well as revenue that could be generated through such a process. Currently, federal marijuana enforcement costs several billion dollars per year. A 2013 report by the American Civil Liberties Union found that the costs at that time were approximately $3.6 billion per year.14\uFEFF The more states that legalize cannabis, the lower the cost of enforcement would likely be; if marijuana were to be legalized on a national level, these costs would likely drop considerably. If marijuana were removed from the list of controlled substances, far fewer court cases involving the substance would go to trial, resulting in fewer incarcerations, and, in turn, more money saved.\n\nLegalized marijuana also stands to benefit medical consumers of cannabis-based products. As marijuana becomes legal in more and more parts of the country, it's likely that the price will drop overall as a result of commoditization. This may not immediately seem like good news for overall tax revenue or for marijuana companies looking to maximize profits. However, individuals utilizing marijuana-based products for medical treatment would stand to benefit considerably from lower prices for these items.\n\nBottom Line\nThere is ample pushback against the idea of legalizing marijuana across the country. Critics cite the potential for confusion among law enforcement officers aiming to keep up with shifting regulations, a concern about increased homelessness or youth use of the drug, the potential for decreased property values, and much more. Some are opposed to changing the regulatory status of marijuana simply because it means a change to the status quo. All of these reasons combine to decrease the likelihood that marijuana will become legal at a national level any time soon. However, as more and more states move to individually decriminalize pot use in various ways, and as the economic benefits of a legal marijuana industry take effect, there are also many compelling reasons to consider nationwide legalization."}
  ,{"title":  "Opinion: Why I’m voting Liberal and think you should too",
      "content" : "When people ask me why I’m a Liberal, my answer is simple: I believe that everyone should have a fair chance in life.\n\nIt’s idealistic, sure—but I wholeheartedly believe that no matter who you are and where you come from, you should have every opportunity to put food on your table, provide for your family, attend post-secondary education and live a good life. \n\nIn 2015, Canadians sent a clear message to Ottawa. They wanted real change. After almost a decade under former Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the Conservatives, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals were brought to power, promising to make life more affordable for Canadians, tackle climate change and work towards a renewed nation-to-nation relationship with Indigenous peoples. \n\nAfter four short years in government, I am more than pleased with the progress that has been made. The Liberals’ first order of business was cutting taxes on the middle class, and replacing the Harper-era system with the fairer Canada Child Benefit, which is based on income.\n\nSince the benefit program was introduced, 300,000 Canadian children have been lifted out of poverty and we currently have the lowest poverty rate in Canadian history. That’s huge.  \n\nClimate change is undoubtedly on our minds as young people. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that we are the last generation who can prevent climate change from having irreversible effects on our planet.\n\nThe Liberals have a real plan to tackle climate change—with over 50 greenhouse-gas-reducing measures—including investments in renewables to get to 90 per cent clean energy, phasing out coal and making zero-emission vehicles more affordable and more accessible.\n\nLastly, they are putting a price on pollution, which—contrary to what the Conservatives say—will leave most Canadians with more money in their pockets through the Climate Action Incentive. Also huge. \n\nIs it enough? Absolutely not. We need to take stronger action on climate change.\n\nBut, we also need to ensure nobody gets left behind in the clean energy transition. We need to work harder to deconstruct the colonial system that has subjugated Indigenous peoples for centuries. We need to continue to break down the barriers to good health that too many people still face every day. There is much more to be done. \n\nThe truth is, Canada has never elected a federal government that was not Liberal or Conservative—or a combination of both—and that’s not going to change in the next election. If the Liberals lose in October, Andrew Scheer will be prime minister. \n\nIn Ontario, Premier Doug Ford’s “Progressive” Conservative government has slashed vital services that people depend on each and every day.\n\nCuts to autism funding has left families wondering what’s next for their children, and cuts to education mean larger class sizes, no 21st century sex and health education curriculum, and no Indigenous history curriculum—an important call to action from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. \n\nAnd as I’m sure you’re aware, the Ford government made cuts to OSAP. They are making education less accessible and affordable for young people across the province. Ask your fellow students, are you worried about debt from your student loans? I sure am. \n\nThe Liberals have invested in our country’s young people by increasing Canada Student Grants by 50 per cent, doubling the number of jobs created through the Canada Summer Jobs program and investing in the Youth Employment Strategy.\n\nGiving young Canadians the skills they need to succeed is vital to ensuring youth enter the job market prepared and equipped, and the Liberals understand that. \n\nIn October, I would like to elect a government that continues to make significant progress to make people’s lives better. Governments that gut social programs frankly scare me, and this election, there is so much to lose.   \n\nAt the end of the day, when young people go out and vote, governments make policy decisions that benefit young people. That’s a fact.\n\nSo, I leave you with my final plea: no matter who you vote for this election, go out and cast your ballot. You have a voice and you deserve to be heard.\n\n"}
  ,{"title" :  "How Liberalism Failed",
      "content" :  "he Captured Economy: How the Powerful Enrich Themselves, Slow Down Growth, and Increase Inequality\nby Brink Lindsey and Steven M. Teles\nOxford University Press, 2017, 232 pp.\n\nGo Back to Where You Came From: The Backlash Against Immigration and the Fate of Western Democracy\nby Sasha Polakow-Suransky\nNation Books, 2017, 368 pp.\n\nCounter-Revolution: Liberal Europe in Retreat\nby Jan Zielonka\nOxford University Press, 2018, 176 pp.\n\n\nToday, the West is probably facing its greatest crisis since the end of the Second World War. Liberal democracy has faltered in Eastern Europe, is threatened by populists in Western Europe and the United States, and is being challenged by resurgent authoritarianism in Russia, China, and elsewhere. Reflecting these trends, scholarship and commentary has become consumed by debates about “illiberal democracy,” “global authoritarianism,” and democratic “deconsolidation.” Summing up what has become a widespread view, Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s current prime minister, recently proclaimed: “The era of liberal democracy is over.”\n\nA massive amount of ink has already been spilled trying to figure out what has gone wrong, but two narratives can be plucked from the confusion. The first focuses on economic change. Over the past few decades growth has slowed, inequality has risen, and social mobility has declined, particularly in the United States. This has made life more insecure for the working and middle classes by privileging highly educated and urban dwellers over less-educated and rural ones, and spreading economic risk, fear of the future, and social divisions throughout Western societies. The second narrative focuses on social change. During this same period, traditional norms and attitudes about religion, sexuality, family life, and more have been challenged by the emergence of feminist, LGBTI, and other social movements. Meanwhile, massive immigration and (especially in the United States) the mobilization of hitherto oppressed minority groups like African Americans has disrupted existing status and political hierarchies, making many white citizens in particular uncomfortable, resentful, and angry.\n\nMost analysis stops here, at viewing economic or social change or some combination of the two as leading inevitably to dissatisfaction with liberal democracy and a readiness to embrace populist, illiberal, or even undemocratic alternatives. The issue, of course, is that social, economic, and technological change alone are not the problem—they only become so if politicians and governments don’t help citizens adjust to them. If we want, therefore, to understand liberal democracy’s current problems, we need to examine not only such changes, but also how elites and governments have responded to them.\n\nA good place to start is with The Captured Economy, in which a libertarian, Brink Lindsey, and a liberal, Steven M. Teles, explain why we ended up with a version of capitalism inimical to healthy democracy, particularly in the United States, where its downsides are clear. The standard explanation focuses on how the growth of information technology and globalization have “given rise to winner-take-all markets with huge windfalls for economic superstars.” While Lindsey and Teles do not entirely reject this narrative, they argue that government has played a large and underappreciated role in creating or exacerbating these problems. They describe how the misregulation of the financial sector enriched the financial elite and introduced unnecessary risks and distortions into the economy; how the expansion of copyright and patent protection has created “monopolies,” limited innovation, and showered “riches on a favored few”; how occupational licensing protects incumbent firms and favored professions and obstructs competition, entrepreneurship, and consumer interests; and how land-use regulations and zoning distort markets, hamper Americans’ ability to move where opportunity is, and instead redistribute wealth to “higher-income homeowners and the bankers who provide mortgage finance” to them.\n\nWhy has government acted in socially counterproductive and economically inefficient ways? Because it has been “captured” by plutocrats who use economic resources to influence government policy in ways that rig the game even further. Lindsey and Teles stress that our “captured” economy has had not only deleterious economic but also political consequences: the inability of leaders and institutions to deliver prosperity to most people has undermined the latter’s confidence in democracy and contributed to growing intolerance: “When people feel economically insecure,” Lindsey and Teles note, “they grow more defensive, less open and generous, and more suspicious of ‘the Other.’ When life seems like a zero-sum struggle, gains by other groups are interpreted as losses by one’s own group.”\n\nThe left will disagree with parts of this analysis—in particular, how Lindsey and Teles prioritize economic efficiency over justice or equality when evaluating policies, and their skepticism that government intervention can be a force for good. But The Captured Economy is nonetheless invaluable in highlighting the myriad ways government has been “captured” by the powerful, thereby disfiguring our economy, society, and democracy.\n\n \nSasha Polakow-Suransky’s Go Back to Where You Came From examines how immigration has roiled Western democracies. Polakow-Suransky’s focus is on Europe, where a backlash against immigration has led to a widespread embrace of xenophobic policies and fed the rise of nationalism and populism. In Western Europe, anti-immigrant parties are in power in Italy and Austria, and threaten existing governments and political stability in Germany, France, Sweden, and elsewhere. The situation is even worse in Eastern Europe, where xenophobes rule in Hungary and Poland. He argues that debate in many European countries has become dominated by fear—of an Islamic “tsunami,” terrorism, crime, and the decline of Western civilization. Such fears over the years have led to a willingness to consider policies that not long ago would have been rejected as too anti-liberal or reactionary, including restricting the right to asylum and restraining the free movement of people across Europe’s borders.\n\nHowever, perhaps the most disturbing section of Go Back to Where You Came From focuses not on Europe but Australia, where even without the presence of an openly far-right populist party, immigration policy came to involve dragooning refugees and asylum seekers on an island in Papua New Guinea where conditions are dismal and human rights abuses rife. This policy is nonetheless broadly supported by Australian politicians since it keeps immigrants far from the country’s shores and beyond the reach of the rule of law. It has become a model for Europe’s far right for precisely these reasons—and a version of it was recently considered by the EU with so-called “reception” centers to be set up in Libya and other parts of North Africa for the purpose of detaining potential migrants.\n\nBut Go Back to Where You Came From makes clear that it is not merely the existence of social change or immigration that has caused problems, but the liberal establishment’s response—or lack thereof—to it. (Polakow-Suransky also considers the backlash against immigration in South Africa, where there have been riots and even violence against African immigrants—not merely by white but also black South Africans, with whom these immigrants live and economically compete.) Over the past few decades the number of foreign-born citizens has risen to historically unprecedented levels in Europe, yet mainstream politicians and parties seem to have given little consideration to ensuring that the policies and institutional capacities (for example, the huge expansion in education services and retraining programs for adults) necessary to manage such change were in place. How would welfare states be protected? Could asylum and immigration applications be quickly and fairly processed? How would labor-market and other forms of integration be accomplished? How could the social cohesion necessary for healthy democracy be maintained? Of course, in Europe the situation was made even worse since layered on to national-level deficiencies was a lack of planning and institutional capacity at the EU level. Recent clashes over immigration between Angela Merkel and Horst Seehofer, her interior minister, and between Germany and the Southern European countries (which are typically first points of entry) illustrate these conflicts over responsibility for immigrants and asylum seekers.\n\nPolakow-Suransky argues that liberals’ “failure to confront the real tensions and failures of integration, by pretending violent extremism and attacks on free speech were not problems, infuriated many voters and left them feeling abandoned by mainstream parties.” He is also particularly critical of the left for refusing to acknowledge problems within immigrant communities such as crime, unemployment, and radicalization and for believing that national sentiment should be “purged” and replaced by cosmopolitanism. These missteps helped create a political opening for the populist right, which took over, albeit in warped ways, positions that used to be the provenance of the left, including a defense of the welfare state, activist government, and secular values, while also reaching out to workers and other alienated voters who in a previous era would have voted for social democratic or communist parties.\n\n \nAn even more damning and direct indictment of the liberal establishment’s culpability for democracy’s contemporary problems is provided by Jan Zielonka’s Counter-Revolution: Liberal Europe in Retreat. Counter-Revolution is written as a letter to Zielonka’s mentor and predecessor at Oxford, Ralf Dahrendorf, who, after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, wrote a short book called Reflections on the Revolution in Europe (also ostensibly written as a letter) pondering where Europe was headed after 1989. Many, of course, believed that after communism’s collapse in 1989 liberal democracy’s triumph and European unity was assured. But Zielonka, like Dahrendorf, grew up under tyranny (communist Poland and Nazi Germany, respectively) and is particularly aware of how fragile both democracy and peace can be. Zielonka believes that we are currently in the midst of nothing less than a “concerted effort to dismantle” liberal democracy, open societies and economies, cultural tolerance, religious neutrality, the European Union—all the elements upon which Western success was built after 1945. Zielonka’s disappointment, sometimes anger, at liberal democratic elites and intellectuals for not protecting against this onslaught suffuses every page of Counter-Revolution. “[L]iberals,” he states, “proved better at finger-pointing than at self-reflection. They spend more time explaining the rise of populism than the fall of liberalism. They refuse to look in the mirror and recognize their own shortcomings, which led to the populist surge across the continent.” For Zielonka these shortcomings involve facilitating the trends currently menacing liberal democracy including rising inequality, a backlash against globalization, and nativism.\n\nZielonka takes liberals to task for their denigration of communal links and identities. Most people, he notes, “feel ‘at home’ with like-minded and like-looking people, they trust those whom they know.” Wishing these realities away is unhelpful. If liberals want to defend liberal values, particularly pluralism and tolerance, they need to figure out how to “create harmony, solidarity and communal spirit, which are needed for any serious collective endeavors.” These arguments are not, Zielonka insists, populist demagoguery—progressive communitarian critiques of liberal ideas have been made by thinkers like Michael Walzer, Michael Sandel, and Charles Taylor. Liberals ignored the challenges posed by cultural and demographic changes and failed to envision how to make them compatible with social stability. This provided an opening for populists and other anti-liberal and anti-democratic figures to insist that homogeneity was the only way to protect national harmony and traditions.\n\nZielonka is equally scathing about liberal elites’ acceptance of (or at least acquiescence in) unregulated markets, austerity, and the disproportionate accumulation of wealth by the rich. Quoting George Soros, he notes that liberals should have recognized the danger of a version of capitalism that “holds that the common good is best served by the uninhibited pursuit of self-interest. Unless tempered by the recognition of a common interest that ought to take presence over particular interests, our present system is liable to break down.” Zielonka argues neoliberal capitalism has created deep economic and geographical divisions. (He notes, for example, that in his home country of Poland, although growth rates have been high over the past decades, their rewards have been very unequally spread and precarious jobs lacking social benefits have become commonplace.) Neoliberal capitalism raises the question of whether democratic elites are able to control markets and protect societies. If they are not, is it any surprise voters have grown dissatisfied and disillusioned with them?\n\nThis brings Zielonka to the European Union, which was supposed to be the “transnational public authority capable of regulating transnational markets.” But, like national governments, the EU turned out to be unable or unwilling to play this role. Zielonka argues that the EU’s support for economic liberalization and austerity and its inability to mitigate their painful effects or provide mechanisms for Europeans to voice their opposition to them has eroded its legitimacy.\n\nThe undermining of national power by the EU insulated democratic politicians and institutions from the “voice of the people” by turning decision-making over to regulatory bodies, central banks, and technocrats. Zielonka again charges liberals with the rise of technocracy: as “public pressure [came to be] considered irresponsible if not dangerous,” “professional politicians . . . bankers and jet-set experts” told “majorities what is best for them,” and the electorate was increasingly “deprived . . . of a say on politics.” If the defenders of liberal democracy can’t convince citizens that their voices count, then they should not be surprised when populism wins.\n\nAfter many decades of relative stability, Western elites forgot how precious and precarious liberal democracy actually is. And perhaps because the collapse of communism further blinded many to the tensions and vulnerabilities inherent in capitalist liberal democracy, elites seem to have forgotten that stability must be grounded in an equitable economy that supports diverse communities. Our task today is figuring out how to recreate such conditions.\n\n"}
  ,{"title": "Opinion: Why I’m Voting for the Conservative Party",
      "content":  "Energy and pipelines are some of the most important issues of this campaign, and Andrew Scheer is the only party leader fully committed to realizing Canada’s full potential as a major energy producer. \n\nDeveloping our nation’s energy and pipeline capacity is crucial for several reasons. The construction of pipelines that allow for the transport of Canadian oil to both coasts would not only create thousands of jobs for Canadians, it would also enable us to sell our oil at a higher price on the world market. This would prove a significant improvement over our current situation, in which oil is sold exclusively, and at a discount, to the United States. Moreover, energy and pipeline development would significantly increase Canada’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), resulting in higher revenues for the federal government, more money in the pockets of Canadians, and more funds available to tackle climate change by investing in, for example, nuclear power, carbon capture technology, and green home initiatives. \n\nWhether we like it or not, we will rely on petroleum for the foreseeable future. Every day we use oil-made products ranging from smart-phone cases to sneakers. Let’s face it: until other technologies become cheaper and more efficient than they currently are, petroleum will continue to supply the energy needs of billions of people. As such, we need to balance fulfilling our energy needs with tackling the climate crisis – abandoning pipelines and neglecting energy development is not the solution. \n\nIf we pursue the NDP-Green-Liberal path of Canadian energy development, we will be forced to continue transporting oil by tanker and rail, thereby unnecessarily compounding our carbon footprint. Furthermore, we would have to keep importing oil from nations such as Saudi Arabia with poor environmental and human rights track records. Such actions could be conceived of as supporting foreign dictatorships.\n\nAdditionally, further pipeline development could appease the 25 per cent of Albertans in favour of separatism, and prevent Canada from having to revisit the unity crises of the 1980s and 90s. By fully developing our energy sector through pipeline expansion, Westerners will no longer feel that they are being scorned by their fellow Canadians. Federal support for Alberta’s economy is especially important for national unity given the current sense that provinces like the Maritimes and Quebec unfairly benefit from equalization payments while simultaneously denigrating Alberta’s economic mode.  \n\nMeanwhile, the NDP and Greens are outright opposed to any further development of pipelines and oilsands. As for the Liberals, while they pay lip service to energy development, under Trudeau, pipeline construction has ground to a halt, and Bill C-69 has made further development all but impossible.\n\nOn the other hand, Andrew Scheer has unreservedly committed to declaring federal jurisdiction over the Trans-mountain pipeline, and has further promised to expedite consultation with Indigenous stakeholders by appointing a special representative. Additionally, he has promised to repeal Bill C-69, thus opening the way for further pipeline projects like Energy East, which will allow our nation to see the benefits of harnessing our energy potential. \n\nThe Conservative Party is, in this sense, the perfect choice to heighten our nation’s unity, grow our economy, and, by increasing available funds, lower our environmental impact. \n\nThe Only Party Truly Committed to Fiscal Discipline\nFurther, the Conservatives are the only party committed both to balancing the budget and cutting taxes for ordinary Canadians. Deficits, by adding onto to the national debt, are a sure guarantee of higher taxes, more toil for business, and harm to young Canadians when, inevitably, this national debt has to be repaid. Trudeau, in a time of economic growth, has run consecutive deficits every year he was in office, with projections suggesting that we will not have a balanced budget until 2040. Today’s students will be tomorrow’s bearers of this debt, making voting for the Liberals a financially irresponsible choice for voters like me. \n\nBy contrast, Andrew Scheer has committed to balancing the budget by the end of the 2020s  through more restrained spending. He has, for instance, promised to cut corporate welfare by decreasing the subsidies received by bloated and inefficient companies, thereby reducing the burden on taxpayers. Moreover, Scheer is also the only leader promising to cut both personal and corporate income taxes, reducing the lowest tax bracket for Canadians to 13.5%, as compared to the current lowest tax rate of 15%. This would put more money into the pockets of citizens and encourage our country’s businesses to expand to their full potential, creating more jobs and offering higher wages for Canadians. \n\nNo More Trudeau\nFinally, do we truly want Justin Trudeau in power for another four years? A Prime Minister capable of some of the most reprehensible ethical violations in modern Canadian history, including the notorious SNC-Lavalin scandal? \n\nMoreover, the Liberals have frequently faltered and have continuously failed to uphold their promises at a time when our country needs strong leadership – leadership that I believe the Conservatives can provide. In my opinion, voting for the Conservatives, not the Liberals, is truly choosing the way forward: voting Conservative means voting for ordinary Canadians, for economic growth, and for unity.\n\nEdited by Emma Massucci Templier.\n\nThis opinion piece is part of a broader week-long MJPS Online series on voting intentions.
